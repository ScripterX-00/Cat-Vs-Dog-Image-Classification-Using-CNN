# Cat-Vs-Dog-Image-Classification-Using-CNN
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of cats and dogs. The model learns visual patterns such as shapes, textures, and edges from images and predicts whether the given image is a cat or a dog.


# Project Overview

Image classification is a fundamental task in Computer Vision. In this project:

- Input: Images of cats and dogs
- Output: Binary classification (Cat / Dog)
- Model: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- Framework: TensorFlow / Keras
